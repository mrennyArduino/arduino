### Model vs Recorded Values Using R
![image](/assets/images/fig.png)

After running the data through R, I obtained the coefficients for each of the parameters and then plotted the model over the original data. Note that the data was cross sectionsed such that hours 45-120 were not included. This choice was made as these time periods represent data taken from the plant when it was not hydrated, and we wanted to train on "healthy" plant data. 

Overall, the model fits fairly well, typically reproducing accurate values and placing daily minima at the right time point over data it trained on. Looking at the data we asked it to predict on its own, values are typically higher than should be physiologically possible [expected maximum value is 0 MPa], but diurnal behavior is still evident. We also note that, unlike the commercial sensor the control data was taken from, average night time values of water potential are about constant, as is expected.

The one to one plot highlights these findings in another visualization: Data taken during hydrated times fits the y=x line [ideal line] fairly, but drought points are almost exlusivley clustered above the trained data's fit line.

There is much more to consider when thinking about what independent variables to include in this model, however the scope of this work was to just explore a first attempt at using a new method on data obtained from an organic bioelectronic sensor. Considering this goal, we have obtained success and promise that this method provides valuable insights to the device physics most at play in sensing water potential, the desired signal, over temperature, the undesired signal.
